# 🎯 Number Guessing Game in C

This is a simple terminal-based number guessing game written in the C programming language.

## 💡 How it works:
- The program generates a random number between **1 and 100**.
- You guess the number.
- If your guess is **too high**, it says “Lower number please!”
- If your guess is **too low**, it says “Higher number please!”
- It keeps track of the **number of attempts**.
- When you guess it correctly, it shows a **congratulatory message** and how many guesses you took.
